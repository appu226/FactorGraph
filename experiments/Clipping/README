*** Running ClippingAndAbstractMulti      ***
*** on the bdd blif bench mark test cases ***
*********************************************

1. How to run
   Go to the root source folder and run:
     experiments/Clipping/run_all_test_cases.sh

2. Test cases
   The test has been run on the bdd_blif data set, which consist of
     a set of digital circuits in th blif format.
   The location of the input data can be customized as a parameter 
     to the blif_solve command in run_one_test_case.sh.
   Each circuit has, at the base level, 4 types of variables:
   - primary input variables v_pi
   - primary output variables
   - latch input variables
   - latch output variables
   Along with these, there are many Tseitin helper variables which connect these variables
     to give a sequence of bdds (which we call "factors" F), 
     the conjunction of which describes the overall circuit.
   In order to prove properties about the state of the circuit 
     regardless of the values of the primary input variables,
     we want to existentially quantify out these variables.
   I.e., we are try to compute:
     \exists v_pi (F_1 \and F_2 \and ... \and F_n)

   *************************************************
   *** In other words, we are projecting         ***
   *** the conjunction of all the factors        ***
   *** onto all the non primary input variables. ***
   *************************************************

3. Tests for each case
   For each data set, (starting from the smallest by file size to the largest),
     we loop over many clipping depths.
   The conjunction and projection is implemented
     as a single depth first traversal of all the factors.
   The result is computed exactly until a maximum depth (the clipping depth),
     after which it is over-approximated to "true".
   For each data set, for each value of the clipping depth,
     the computations were bounded by 2 mins.
   The computations were run with -O3 flag on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-4030U CPU @ 1.90GHz chip
   with 3.8G RAM plus 3.7G Swap memory.

4. Results
   The results are summarized in a table in
     experiments/Clipping/summary.txt
   The index of this table, explaining the meaning of various columns:

   Detailed logs from which results have been scraped are compressed in:
