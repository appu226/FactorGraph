All timings are in seconds.

nClauses      -> number of clauses in input cnf
nVars         -> number of variables in input cnf
parseTim      -> time taken to parse cnf
bddCreat      -> time taken to create bdds of clauses
mergeTim      -> time taken to merge factor and variable BDDs based on Largest Support Set input parameter
mergedFn      -> number of factors after merging
mergedVr      -> number of variables after merging
FG Creat      -> time taken to create Factor Graph from merged factors and variables
FG Iters      -> number of iterations to reach factor graph convergence
FG Conv       -> time taken to converge Factor Graph
CNF Creat     -> time taken to convert Factor Graph solution to CNF
nSoln         -> number of MUSes found by MUST that added a clause to final solution
nDisabledSets -> number of disabled sets in MUST problem space due to MUSes that satisfied Factor Graph
numMus        -> total number of MUSes found
case name     -> test case name
